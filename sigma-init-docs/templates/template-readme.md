# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Work repo

Read this file before you add a file. The layout is closed.

## Lane

`/sigma-init-docs` → `/sigma-plan` → `/sigma-to-spec` → `/sigma-to-tickets` → `/sigma-implement` (one ticket, branch `agent/{N}-{slug}`, its own chat; commits scripts; does not review) → `/sigma-review` (a different chat) → `/sigma-pr` → `/sigma-merge`

Each command stops and names the next command. None of them invoke the next.

`/sigma-unslop` is off the lane. It writes `docs/reviews/<date>-<topic>.md` when the user runs it. Issues still go through `/sigma-create-ticket`.

## Code

`scripts/` is the only code home. Each file is an API call named in the ticket. `/sigma-implement` commits that file.

An application tree or a second code folder has no row in the write-scope table. Ask.

## Write scope

| Path | Owner |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `.gitignore` | `/sigma-init-docs` |
| `docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md` | `/sigma-plan` |
| `docs/reviews/<date>-<topic>.md` | `/sigma-unslop` (not created up front) |
| `scripts/**` named in the ticket | `/sigma-implement` |
| GitHub issues | `/sigma-create-ticket` only |

If nothing fits, ask. Do not invent a path. Do not create a loose file at `docs/` root, a new top-level doc folder, or a `-vN` filename.

The only file at `docs/` root is `docs/README.md`.

## Scaffold

This command writes `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md` (headings only, until `/sigma-plan`), and `scripts/.gitkeep`. It writes `.gitignore` (`.DS_Store` and `.worktrees/`) only when that file is missing. It does not create `docs/reviews/`.
